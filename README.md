# Exploratory Data Analysis using Python
This project demonstrates a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process performed on a dataset containing world population statistics. The analysis includes data loading, cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Python.
____
# Key Features and Tasks Performed
1. Data Loading:
Loaded the dataset using Pandas from a CSV file named World Population EDA.csv.

2. Initial Exploration
Inspected the dataset structure using .info() and .describe() to understand data types, missing values, and statistical summaries.

3. Data Cleaning
Standardized numeric formats for better readability using Pandas' formatting options.

4. Exploratory Analysis
Examined relationships, trends, and distributions using the following techniques:
Identified key statistical metrics such as mean, median, and percentiles.
Aggregated and grouped data to analyze population patterns across regions.

5. Visualization
Created insightful visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn, including:
Histograms to analyze distribution.
Scatter plots for correlations between variables.
Heatmaps to visualize missing data and correlations.
____
# Technologies and Libraries Used
